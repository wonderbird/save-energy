# Product Context

## Problem

The "Save Energy" application addresses the environmental impact of digital infrastructure. Continuous integration builds, dependency checks, and artifact storage for inactive projects consume significant energy. This tool provides users with a straightforward way to identify and manage these repositories, promoting digital sustainability.

## Vision

The vision is to provide a simple, user-friendly tool that lists a user's GitHub repositories and highlights those that have been inactive for an extended period. This enables users to make informed decisions about archiving or deleting projects that are no longer in active development.
