# Relevant GitHub API Endpoints

[./github-rest-api.http](./github-rest-api.http) contains a collection of GitHub API requests relevant to the project.

Before you can run the REST requests, you need to register a GitHub App as described in [Authentication Setup](./authentication-setup.md). Then update the configuration in the [./http-client.env.json](./http-client.env.json) file.
